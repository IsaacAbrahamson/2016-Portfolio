## About
This was the first website that I ever made. I didn't even know how to host a website, so I threw it in my Dropbox and made it public (they discontinued this feature shortly later that year).

I had started the freeCodeCamp web development curriculum, and the first project was building a portfolio site. Most students built something simple and updated it later, but I decided to make it the best site that I could. I had only been building websites for a few weeks, and I spent hours obsessing over every detail. Looking back, I am pretty impressed at how well it holds up today, and it's still responsive!
