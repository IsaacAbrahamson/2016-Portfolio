## About
This was the first real website that I ever made. I didn't even know how to host a website, so I threw it in my Dropbox and made it public (they discontinued this feature shortly later that year).

I had started the freeCodeCamp web development curriculum, and the first project was building a portfolio site. Most students built something simple and updated it later, but I decided to make it the best site that I could. I had only been building websites for a few weeks, and I spent hours obsessing over every detail. Looking back, I am pretty impressed at how well it holds up today, and it's still responsive!

Somehow the original Dropbox site got deleted, so I had to scroll back through my CodePen archives to find this. Unfortunately, all of the image links had changed, but I was able to find the header photo that I orginally used and edit it close to what I had six years ago. The placeholder images in the portfolio section are different, but I had just used generic placeholder images then anyway.
